# DeepLearning_ComputerVision
A collection of convolutional neural network models for various computer vision tasks

----

These are part of the projects that I have worked on during the Deep Learning and TensorFlow courses, including the **Deep Learning Specialization** courses and **Tensorflow Advanced Developer** courses on Coursera which are offered by **Deeplearning.ai**. I will also gradually add the rest of the related computer vision projects that I have accomplished in other courses to this repository to keep a complete set of computer vision projects.
